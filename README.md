# Go Fun

This repository is to allow me to mess around with Go and learn.

## Getting Started

This repo is intended to be part of a larger workspace. As such, we assume the workspace looks like this:

```bash
bin/
pkg/
src/
  github.com/
    hello/
```

The project can be built as follows:

```bash
go build hello
```
